    <h1>GOD GUIDE</h1>
    <pre>
Lord, guide my way,
Through this life's fray,
Let sin not lead astray,
In fear's sway,
Keep me close to your holy ray.

God,
Craft me as your mirror,
Reflecting your superior,
Shine amid the inferior,
Show your power in the darkest interior,
Where fears dwell,
But I shall not cower.

God,
This is my plea,
Guard every part of me,
From the devil's glee,
Feasting upon souls like a spree,
Strengthen my hand,
Make it your tool grand,
To shatter the devil's brand,
Let me be your sanctuary,
Where troubled souls find the ordinary extraordinary.

God,
Mold me to be your well,
Quenching thirst for those unwell.

This prayer is mine,
Hallelujah's shine,
All honor and glory, Thine.

God,
Make me your peace envoy,
Utilize my being to deploy,
Restoring tranquility to hearts that destroy.

Lord,
I beseech thee today,
Calm these forces at play,
Fake prophets leading astray,
In the messiah's name, they sway,
For their own gain,
May their deceitful reign wane.

Lord,
This is my prayer, I declare,
In reverence, Amen.

		<h1>ORDINARILY </h1>
		<pre>
Rushing not, yet set in stride,
Bearing burdens, no time to bide,
Life's currents pull and sway,
Still, an unwavering smile holds sway,
So ordinary, in an extraordinary way.

Slumbering past the hour's chime,
Rise in haste, no wasted time,
Avoiding lateness, a daily quest,
Fear of locked gates, an unwelcome guest,
Extra hours to amend the day's crime,
Homeward bound, yet smiles align,
No fret, no hurry,
So ordinary.

Delays in pay, a dreaded scene,
Check procedures, a long routine,
Bills persist, a constant theme,
Still smiling, swallowing disappointment's sheen,
Late returns, nights routine,
Late to bed, early to glean,
Rushed to work in a flurried blur,
So ordinary, yet enduring.

Payday arrives, feels heaven-sent,
Forgetting the toils, so content,
Check on the right, bills on the left,
Numbers jumble, a mind-bending theft,
Salary versus bills, a mismatch evident,
Consider an advance, life's bent.

Slumbering late, rising with the sun,
Work-bound in haste, day's duties begun,
Leaving late, wearing that familiar grin,
So ordinary, yet finding joy within.

		<h1>BED OF DECIET</h1>
		<pre>
May the tears she cried over him drown her,
And let the echoes of her bad mouthing deafen her.
All the negative thoughts she harbored about him,
Drive her mind to realms unknown, a whirlwind grim.

As she runs into another's arms, may fate find her,
Breaking legs, stumbling in her hasty blur.
Each lie she told him, now gospel truth to his ear,

A heart once shattered, let it be a distant fear.

A serpent, the least to describe her in this sad song,
Slithering through his thoughts, where she doesn't belong.
Coiled in his mind, blinding his sight so keen,
Your slithering presence, a venomous sheen.

Murmuring and flapping lips of deceit's hue,
Masking lust with words that seem true.

No curse to cast, just a light to shine,
On sins that match, in this twisted design.

Love, a lie spun to fulfill her whims,
Vanished without a trace, when the need brims.
Abandoned in knots, without a goodbye note,
Karma's ledger, I hope it did denote.

Knocking soon, as fate dictates the score,
Just as she left, let it stay forevermore. 


May she learn from the ache she caused,
In the broken pieces, her remorse be paused.
For every wound inflicted, a lesson to impart,
To awaken empathy, within her heart's chart.

And as time unfolds its mysterious art,
May she find redemption, a brand-new start.
Let karma's echo resonate, a gentle knock,
Teaching her humility, in life's intricate clock.

		<h1>NOSTALGIA</h1>
		<pre>
Last night,  
I couldn't sleep;  
I kept turning  
and thinking  
how calm and warming  
your touch felt  
on my skin  
beneath the sheets.

I wanted to cry,  
but my pillow was already soaked,  
and I couldn't shake off the shock  
that you are not coming back.  
I really tried to cry,  
but instead, I started to draw  
your image  
to ease the imagination.

I traced all the scars  
and all the curves,  
missing and admiring what I will never have.  
It felt awful  
roaming through the night like an owl,  
like a lost soul.

The home  
that you kept warm  
is now just a house,  
cold and silent  
without your presence.  
The past is making more sense  
because the present,  
without your presence,  
is more than absent.

*P.S.: What we had was real,  
but I guess good things don't last forever.*  
*That's why I'm binding you this farewell.*

		<h1>IN THE NAME WE SHARE </h1>
		<pre>
In love's tender arms, my spirit took flight,
Where laughter dances in the soft twilight.
With every heartbeat, the world feels so right,
Boundless affection, an eternal delight.

Through valleys of dreams, where stars ignite,
Our souls entwined, two hearts alight,
In your embrace, all worries take flight,
Love's pure essence, an endless height.

In whispers of breeze, our tale takes flight,
Eternal devotion, an unending sight,
In your eyes, a universe so bright,
Guided by love, through day and night.

		<h1>LOVE AT A, MILE </h1>
		<pre>
Through screens they spoke, FREY and RUTH hearts entwined,
Across the miles, their love undefined,
Texts flew swiftly, emotions refined,
In each typed word, affection enshrined.

"RUTH," she typed, __"this distance is unkind,
Yet in your messages, solace I find,
Each emoji you send, a love assigned,
Through pixels and bytes, our souls aligned."

"FREY," he replied, __"though we're confined,
Our love's a melody, perfectly designed,
In every text, our hearts combined,
Forever linked, our fates intertwined."

As days drifted by, their love didn't rescind,
Shared tales of dreams, hopes intertwined,

"Missing you, 
FREY," he messaged, __entwined,
"Counting minutes till our paths realign."

"Likewise, RUTH," __her text was lined,
"With every word, our bond refined,
Love's bridge across, our hearts defined,
Long-distance, yet our souls assigned."

	    <h1>GEM</h1>
		 <pre>
Love to me was just like a game
For the lame
Where females and males
Who were scared to face the tides alone
Who needed someone to lean on
And a reason to give them hope
To live and die for
If there was nothing to keep them pressing 
on.

An excuse.
A refuge.
To run to when their heart can no longer
keep the pulse.

That was my thoughts,
And I fought.
Not to game.
Then I saw you, a rare gem,
And I told myself I'm game,
And you are the prize.
I figured you as a maze
For how you happened to amaze
With your gaits
As you walked in through the gate
And sat yourself carefully like a fragile and priceless piece
That would break if dropped,
Ready to make your order.

And I told myself you would be my order
If fate would happen to request me to make one.
It would be someone.
Fast forward...

I apologize
For I saw you as a prize to be won.
I was wrong.
I apologize
For premeditating a long con.
On your heart

Thank you.
For helping me know how to love,
And for keeping our hearts warm.

Thank you.
For turning this house into a home,
And for keeping it warm.
Your presence is of essence.

I adore you.
I owe you.
I love you.

		     <h1>Close The door</h1>
Ain't boasting, but peace found me when you packed your bags,  
Boarded a bus, declaring an end to us with no more flags.  
You weren't just a nuisance; you endangered my mental health,  
A vampire, draining all my energy in pursuit of your stealth.

A labyrinth of headaches, navigating your every whim,  
Chasing circles, ending up in your ungrateful, toxic brim.  
Round after round, a chaotic maze of futile tries,  
Until finally, I saw your back, the door, your goodbyes.

Flames flickered as you departed, a finale so surreal,  
And my energy, once captive, now liberated to heal.  
Bursting free from the chains of your toxic grasp,  
In this newfound solitude, my strength began to clasp.

No longer entangled in the web of your disdain,  
In the aftermath, a symphony of liberation's refrain.  
Six stanzas echoing the triumph of letting you go,  
A tale of renewal, strength, and freedom's vibrant flow.
